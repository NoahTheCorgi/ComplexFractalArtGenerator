# ComplexFractalArtGenerator
# Extending classic Mandelbrot approach to create unlimited varied results
# Goal is the create various kinds of Fractal Art, Probabilistic/Non-Probabilistic
- I also plan to add the option to Probabilistic methods to create interesting art
- Personal project of re-writing but also improving a very old project with much more optimization, power, and functionality. 
- The art aspect of things will be emphasized more than the theoretical sanity checks.

In order to create a generator executable from the ComplexFractalArtGenerator directory
, please use the command: javac generate/Generate.java

To run the generator after compiling
, please use the command : java generate/Generate

Key Commands for exploration:
- WASD keys: move camera
- R: randomize color theme
- O: Ordinary/Default non-probabilistic art
- P: Toggle between Probabilistic Art styles
- Up arrow key: zoom in
- Down arrow key: zoom out
